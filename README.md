## Hi there 
- My first name is An, and my last name is Tran, I am Vietnamese
- I’m currently learning Software Engineer at university in Vietnam
- I'm just a newbie, I have just learn some basic c++ since last semester
- In this page, I have already post some of my homeworks to get on with Github and connect with some other great people
- I can make some bugs while learning and practising so I hope that you can help me fix them
- Funfact: I am a huge fan of Pokemon as I have a great passion with animals and creatures.
## Thanks for visiting my pages
